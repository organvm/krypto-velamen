**KRYPTO-VELAMEN** has evolved from a static archive into a distributed, collaborative platform. It is a digital instrument designed to facilitate queer knowledge-building, authentic expression, and community survival through "Double-Channel" communication.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The repository is organized as a Monorepo housing distinct microservices:

```mermaid

    Root --> Apps
    Root --> Services
    Root --> Infrastructure
    
    Apps --> Web[web-platform (Next.js)]
    
    Services --> Identity[identity-service (FastAPI)]
    Services --> Community[community-service (Django)]
    Services --> Graph[knowledge-graph (Neo4j)]
    Services --> Archive[archive-engine (The Core Corpus)]
    Services --> Swarm[agent-swarm (The Spirit)]
    Services --> Titan[titan-governor (The Law)]
    Services --> Atomizer[atomizer-engine (The Molecular)]
    Services --> Lens[lens-engine (The Geometry)]
```

### 📂 Directory Structure
